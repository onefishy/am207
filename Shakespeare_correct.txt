from fairest creatures we desire increase that thereby beautys rose might never die but as the riper should by time decease his tender heir might bear his memory but thou contracted to thine own bright eyes feedst thy lights flame with selfsubstantial fuel making a famine where abundance lies thy self thy foe to thy sweet self too cruel thou that art now the worlds fresh ornament and only herald to the gaudy spring within thine own bud buriest thy content and tender churl makst waste in niggarding pity the world or else this glutton be to eat the worlds due by the grave and thee when forty winters shall besiege thy brow and dig deep trenches in thy beautys field thy youths proud livery so gazed on now will be a totterd weed of small worth held then being asked where all thy beauty lies where all the treasure of thy lusty days to say within thine own deep sunken eyes were an alleating shame and thriftless praise how much more praise deservd thy beautys use if thou couldst answer this fair child of mine shall sum my count and make my old excuse proving his beauty by succession thine this were to be new made when thou art old and see thy blood warm when thou feelst it cold look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest now is the time that face should form another whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest thou dost beguile the world unbless some mother for where is she so fair whose uneared womb disdains the tillage of thy husbandry or who is he so fond will be the tomb of his selflove to stop posterity thou art thy mothers glass and she in thee calls back the lovely april of her prime so thou through windows of thine age shalt see despite of wrinkles this thy golden time but if thou live remembered not to be die single and thine image dies with thee unthrifty loveliness why dost thou spend upon thy self thy beautys legacy natures bequest gives nothing but doth lend and being frank she lends to those are free then beauteous niggard why dost thou abuse the bounteous largess given thee to give profitless usurer why dost thou use so great a sum of sums yet canst not live for having traffic with thy self alone thou of thy self thy sweet self dost deceive then how when nature calls thee to be gone what acceptable audit canst thou leave thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee which used lives th executor to be those hours that with gentle work did frame the lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell will play the tyrants to the very same and that unfair which fairly doth excel for neverresting time leads summer on to hideous winter and confounds him there sap checked with frost and lusty leaves quite gone beauty oersnowed and bareness every where then were not summers distillation left a liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass beautys effect with beauty were bereft nor it nor no remembrance what it was but flowers distilled though they with winter meet leese but their show their substance still lives sweet then let not winters ragged hand deface in thee thy summer ere thou be distilled make sweet some vial treasure thou some place with beautys treasure ere it be selfkilled that use is not forbidden usury which happies those that pay the willing loan thats for thy self to breed another thee or ten times happier be it ten for one ten times thy self were happier than thou art if ten of thine ten times refigured thee then what could death do if thou shouldst depart leaving thee living in posterity be not selfwilled for thou art much too fair to be deaths conquest and make worms thine heir lo in the orient when the gracious light lifts up his burning head each under eye doth homage to his newappearing sight serving with looks his sacred majesty and having climbed the steepup heavenly hill resembling strong youth in his middle age yet mortal looks adore his beauty still attending on his golden pilgrimage but when from highmost pitch with weary car like feeble age he reeleth from the day the eyes fore duteous now converted are from his low tract and look another way so thou thyself outgoing in thy noon unlooked on diest unless thou get a son music to hear why hearst thou music sadly sweets with sweets war not joy delights in joy why lovst thou that which thou receivst not gladly or else receivst with pleasure thine annoy if the true concord of welltuned sounds by unions married do offend thine ear they do but sweetly chide thee who confounds in singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear mark how one string sweet husband to another strikes each in each by mutual ordering resembling sire and child and happy mother who all in one one pleasing note do sing whose speechless song being many seeming one sings this to thee thou single wilt prove none is it for fear to wet a widows eye that thou consumst thy self in single life ah if thou issueless shalt hap to die the world will wail thee like a makeless wife the world will be thy widow and still weep that thou no form of thee hast left behind when every private widow well may keep by childrens eyes her husbands shape in mind look what an unthrift in the world doth spend shifts but his place for still the world enjoys it but beautys waste hath in the world an end and kept unused the user so destroys it no love toward others in that bosom sits that on himself such murdrous shame commits for shame deny that thou bearst love to any who for thy self art so unprovident grant if thou wilt thou art beloved of many but that thou none lovst is most evident for thou art so possessed with murderous hate that gainst thy self thou stickst not to conspire seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate which to repair should be thy chief desire o change thy thought that i may change my mind shall hate be fairer lodged than gentle love be as thy presence is gracious and kind or to thyself at least kindhearted prove make thee another self for love of me that beauty still may live in thine or thee as fast as thou shalt wane so fast thou growst in one of thine from that which thou departest and that fresh blood which youngly thou bestowst thou mayst call thine when thou from youth convertest herein lives wisdom beauty and increase without this folly age and cold decay if all were minded so the times should cease and threescore year would make the world away let those whom nature hath not made for store harsh featureless and rude barrenly perish look whom she best endowed she gave the more which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish she carved thee for her seal and meant thereby thou shouldst print more not let that copy die when i do count the clock that tells the time and see the brave day sunk in hideous night when i behold the violet past prime and sable curls all silvered oer with white when lofty trees i see barren of leaves which erst from heat did canopy the herd and summers green all girded up in sheaves borne on the bier with white and bristly beard then of thy beauty do i question make that thou among the wastes of time must go since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake and die as fast as they see others grow and nothing gainst times scythe can make defence save breed to brave him when he takes thee hence o that you were your self but love you are no longer yours than you your self here live against this coming end you should prepare and your sweet semblance to some other give so should that beauty which you hold in lease find no determination then you were yourself again after yourselfs decease when your sweet issue your sweet form should bear who lets so fair a house fall to decay which husbandry in honour might uphold against the stormy gusts of winters day and barren rage of deaths eternal cold o none but unthrifts dear my love you know you had a father let your son say so not from the stars do i my judgement pluck and yet methinks i have astronomy but not to tell of good or evil luck of plagues of dearths or seasons quality nor can i fortune to brief minutes tell pointing to each his thunder rain and wind or say with princes if it shall go well by oft predict that i in heaven find but from thine eyes my knowledge i derive and constant stars in them i read such art as truth and beauty shall together thrive if from thyself to store thou wouldst convert or else of thee this i prognosticate thy end is truths and beautys doom and date when i consider every thing that grows holds in perfection but a little moment that this huge stage presenteth nought but shows whereon the stars in secret influence comment when i perceive that men as plants increase cheered and checked even by the selfsame sky vaunt in their youthful sap at height decrease and wear their brave state out of memory then the conceit of this inconstant stay sets you most rich in youth before my sight where wasteful time debateth with decay to change your day of youth to sullied night and all in war with time for love of you as he takes from you i engraft you new but wherefore do not you a mightier way make war upon this bloody tyrant time and fortify your self in your decay with means more blessed than my barren rhyme now stand you on the top of happy hours and many maiden gardens yet unset with virtuous wish would bear you living flowers much liker than your painted counterfeit so should the lines of life that life repair which this times pencil or my pupil pen neither in inward worth nor outward fair can make you live your self in eyes of men to give away yourself keeps yourself still and you must live drawn by your own sweet skill who will believe my verse in time to come if it were filled with your most high deserts though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb which hides your life and shows not half your parts if i could write the beauty of your eyes and in fresh numbers number all your graces the age to come would say this poet lies such heavenly touches neer touched earthly faces so should my papers yellowed with their age be scorned like old men of less truth than tongue and your true rights be termed a poets rage and stretched metre of an antique song but were some child of yours alive that time you should live twice in it and in my rhyme shall i compare thee to a summers day thou art more lovely and more temperate rough winds do shake the darling buds of may and summers lease hath all too short a date sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines and often is his gold complexion dimmed and every fair from fair sometime declines by chance or natures changing course untrimmed but thy eternal summer shall not fade nor lose possession of that fair thou owst nor shall death brag thou wanderst in his shade when in eternal lines to time thou growst so long as men can breathe or eyes can see so long lives this and this gives life to thee devouring time blunt thou the lions paws and make the earth devour her own sweet brood pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tigers jaws and burn the longlived phoenix in her blood make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleetst and do whateer thou wilt swiftfooted time to the wide world and all her fading sweets but i forbid thee one most heinous crime o carve not with thy hours my loves fair brow nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen him in thy course untainted do allow for beautys pattern to succeeding men yet do thy worst old time despite thy wrong my love shall in my verse ever live young a womans face with natures own hand painted hast thou the master mistress of my passion a womans gentle heart but not acquainted with shifting change as is false womens fashion an eye more bright than theirs less false in rolling gilding the object whereupon it gazeth a man in hue all hues in his controlling which steals mens eyes and womens souls amazeth and for a woman wert thou first created till nature as she wrought thee fell adoting and by addition me of thee defeated by adding one thing to my purpose nothing but since she prickd thee out for womens pleasure mine be thy love and thy loves use their treasure so is it not with me as with that muse stirred by a painted beauty to his verse who heaven itself for ornament doth use and every fair with his fair doth rehearse making a couplement of proud compare with sun and moon with earth and seas rich gems with aprils firstborn flowers and all things rare that heavens air in this huge rondure hems o let me true in love but truly write and then believe me my love is as fair as any mothers child though not so bright as those gold candles fixed in heavens air let them say more that like of hearsay well i will not praise that purpose not to sell my glass shall not persuade me i am old so long as youth and thou are of one date but when in thee times furrows i behold then look i death my days should expiate for all that beauty that doth cover thee is but the seemly raiment of my heart which in thy breast doth live as thine in me how can i then be elder than thou art o therefore love be of thyself so wary as i not for myself but for thee will bearing thy heart which i will keep so chary as tender nurse her babe from faring ill presume not on thy heart when mine is slain thou gavst me thine not to give back again as an unperfect actor on the stage who with his fear is put beside his part or some fierce thing replete with too much rage whose strengths abundance weakens his own heart so i for fear of trust forget to say the perfect ceremony of loves rite and in mine own loves strength seem to decay oercharged with burthen of mine own loves might o let my looks be then the eloquence and dumb presagers of my speaking breast who plead for love and look for recompense more than that tongue that more hath more expressd o learn to read what silent love hath writ to hear with eyes belongs to loves fine wit mine eye hath played the painter and hath steeled thy beautys form in table of my heart my body is the frame wherein tis held and perspective that is best painters art for through the painter must you see his skill to find where your true image pictured lies which in my bosoms shop is hanging still that hath his windows glazed with thine eyes now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done mine eyes have drawn thy shape and thine for me are windows to my breast wherethrough the sun delights to peep to gaze therein on thee yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art they draw but what they see know not the heart let those who are in favour with their stars of public honour and proud titles boast whilst i whom fortune of such triumph bars unlookd for joy in that i honour most great princes favourites their fair leaves spread but as the marigold at the suns eye and in themselves their pride lies buried for at a frown they in their glory die the painful warrior famoused for fight after a thousand victories once foiled is from the book of honour razed quite and all the rest forgot for which he toiled then happy i that love and am beloved where i may not remove nor be removed lord of my love to whom in vassalage thy merit hath my duty strongly knit to thee i send this written embassage to witness duty not to show my wit duty so great which wit so poor as mine may make seem bare in wanting words to show it but that i hope some good conceit of thine in thy souls thought all naked will bestow it till whatsoever star that guides my moving points on me graciously with fair aspect and puts apparel on my tottered loving to show me worthy of thy sweet respect then may i dare to boast how i do love thee till then not show my head where thou mayst prove me weary with toil i haste me to my bed the dear repose for limbs with travel tired but then begins a journey in my head to work my mind when bodys works expired for then my thoughtsfrom far where i abide intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee and keep my drooping eyelids open wide looking on darkness which the blind do see save that my souls imaginary sight presents thy shadow to my sightless view which like a jewel hung in ghastly night makes black night beauteous and her old face new lo thus by day my limbs by night my mind for thee and for myself no quiet find how can i then return in happy plight that am debarred the benefit of rest when days oppression is not easd by night but day by night and night by day oppressed and each though enemies to eithers reign do in consent shake hands to torture me the one by toil the other to complain how far i toil still farther off from thee i tell the day to please him thou art bright and dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven so flatter i the swartcomplexiond night when sparkling stars twire not thou gildst the even but day doth daily draw my sorrows longer and night doth nightly make griefs length seem stronger when in disgrace with fortune and mens eyes i all alone beweep my outcast state and trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries and look upon myself and curse my fate wishing me like to one more rich in hope featured like him like him with friends possessed desiring this mans art and that mans scope with what i most enjoy contented least yet in these thoughts my self almost despising haply i think on thee and then my state like to the lark at break of day arising from sullen earth sings hymns at heavens gate for thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings that then i scorn to change my state with kings when to the sessions of sweet silent thought i summon up remembrance of things past i sigh the lack of many a thing i sought and with old woes new wail my dear times waste then can i drown an eye unused to flow for precious friends hid in deaths dateless night and weep afresh loves long since cancelled woe and moan the expense of many a vanished sight then can i grieve at grievances foregone and heavily from woe to woe tell oer the sad account of forebemoaned moan which i new pay as if not paid before but if the while i think on thee dear friend all losses are restord and sorrows end thy bosom is endeared with all hearts which i by lacking have supposed dead and there reigns love and all loves loving parts and all those friends which i thought buried how many a holy and obsequious tear hath dear religious love stoln from mine eye as interest of the dead which now appear but things removed that hidden in thee lie thou art the grave where buried love doth live hung with the trophies of my lovers gone who all their parts of me to thee did give that due of many now is thine alone their images i loved i view in thee and thou all they hast all the all of me if thou survive my wellcontented day when that churl death my bones with dust shall cover and shalt by fortune once more resurvey these poor rude lines of thy deceased lover compare them with the bettring of the time and though they be outstripped by every pen reserve them for my love not for their rhyme exceeded by the height of happier men o then vouchsafe me but this loving thought had my friends muse grown with this growing age a dearer birth than this his love had brought to march in ranks of better equipage but since he died and poets better prove theirs for their style ill read his for his love full many a glorious morning have i seen flatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye kissing with golden face the meadows green gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy anon permit the basest clouds to ride with ugly rack on his celestial face and from the forlorn world his visage hide stealing unseen to west with this disgrace even so my sun one early morn did shine with all triumphant splendour on my brow but out alack he was but one hour mine the region cloud hath maskd him from me now yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth suns of the world may stain when heavens sun staineth why didst thou promise such a beauteous day and make me travel forth without my cloak to let base clouds oertake me in my way hiding thy bravery in their rotten smoke tis not enough that through the cloud thou break to dry the rain on my stormbeaten face for no man well of such a salve can speak that heals the wound and cures not the disgrace nor can thy shame give physic to my grief though thou repent yet i have still the loss the offenders sorrow lends but weak relief to him that bears the strong offences cross ah but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds and they are rich and ransom all ill deeds no more be grieved atthat which thou hast done roses have thorns and silver fountains mud clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun and loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud all men make faults and even i in this authorizing thy trespass with compare myself corrupting salving thy amiss excusing thy sins more than thy sins are for to thy sensual fault i bring in sense thy adverse party is thy advocate and gainst myself a lawful plea commence such civil war is in my love and hate that i an accessary needs must be to that sweet thief which sourly robs from me let me confess that we two must be twain although our undivided loves are one so shall those blots that do with me remain without thy help by me be borne alone in our two loves there is but one respect though in our lives a separable spite which though it alter not loves sole effect yet doth it steal sweet hours from loves delight i may not evermore acknowledge thee lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame nor thou with public kindness honour me unless thou take that honour from thy name but do not so i love thee in such sort as thou being mine mine is thy good report as a decrepit father takes delight to see his active child do deeds of youth so i made lame by fortunes dearest spite take all my comfort of thy worth and truth for whether beauty birth or wealth or wit or any of these all or all or more entitled in thy parts do crowned sit i make my love engrafted to this store so then i am not lame poor nor despised whilst that this shadow doth such substance give that i in thy abundance am sufficed and by a part of all thy glory live look what is best that best i wish in thee this wish i have then ten times happy me how can my muse want subject to invent while thou dost breathe that pourst into my verse thine own sweet argument too excellent for every vulgar paper to rehearse o give thy self the thanks if aught in me worthy perusal stand against thy sight for whos so dumb that cannot write to thee when thou thy self dost give invention light be thou the tenth muse ten times more in worth than those old nine which rhymers invocate and he that calls on thee let him bring forth eternal numbers to outlive long date if my slight muse do please these curious days the pain be mine but thine shall be the praise o how thy worth with manners may i sing when thou art all the better part of me what can mine own praise to mine own self bring and what ist but mine own when i praise thee even for this let us divided live and our dear love lose name of single one that by this separation i may give that due to thee which thou deservst alone o absence what a torment wouldst thou prove were it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave to entertain the time with thoughts of love which time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceive and that thou teachest how to make one twain by praising him here who doth hence remain take all my loves my love yea take them all what hast thou then more than thou hadst before no love my love that thou mayst true love call all mine was thine before thou hadst this more then if for my love thou my love receivest i cannot blame thee for my love thou usest but yet be blamd if thou thy self deceivest by wilful taste of what thyself refusest i do forgive thy robbery gentle thief although thou steal thee all my poverty and yet love knows it is a greater grief to bear loves wrong than hates known injury lascivious grace in whom all ill well shows kill me with spites yet we must not be foes those pretty wrongs that liberty commits when i am sometime absent from thy heart thy beauty and thy years full well befits for still temptation follows where thou art gentle thou art and therefore to be won beauteous thou art therefore to be assailed and when a woman woos what womans son will sourly leave her till he have prevailed ay me but yet thou mightst my seat forbear and chide thy beauty and thy straying youth who lead thee in their riot even there where thou art forced to break a twofold truth hers by thy beauty tempting her to thee thine by thy beauty being false to me that thou hast her it is not all my grief and yet it may be said i loved her dearly that she hath thee is of my wailing chief a loss in love that touches me more nearly loving offenders thus i will excuse ye thou dost love her because thou knowst i love her and for my sake even so doth she abuse me suffering my friend for my sake to approve her if i lose thee my loss is my loves gain and losing her my friend hath found that loss both find each other and i lose both twain and both for my sake lay on me this cross but heres the joy my friend and i are one sweet flattery then she loves but me alone when most i wink then do mine eyes best see for all the day they view things unrespected but when i sleep in dreams they look on thee and darkly bright are bright in dark directed then thou whose shadow shadows doth make bright how would thy shadows form form happy show to the clear day with thy much clearer light when to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so how would i say mine eyes be blessed made by looking on thee in the living day when in dead night thy fair imperfect shade through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay all days are nights to see till i see thee and nights bright days when dreams do show thee me if the dull substance of my flesh were thought injurious distance should not stop my way for then despite of space i would be brought from limits far remote where thou dost stay no matter then although my foot did stand upon the farthest earth removed from thee for nimble thought can jump both sea and land as soon as think the place where he would be but ah thought kills me that i am not thought to leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone but that so much of earth and water wrought i must attend times leisure with my moan receiving nought by elements so slow but heavy tears badges of eithers woe the other two slight air and purging fire are both with thee wherever i abide the first my thought the other my desire these presentabsent with swift motion slide for when these quicker elements are gone in tender embassy of love to thee my life being made of four with two alone sinks down to death oppressed with melancholy until lifes composition be recured by those swift messengers returnd from thee who even but now come back again assured of thy fair health recounting it to me this told i joy but then no longer glad i send them back again and straight grow sad mine eye and heart are at a mortal war how to divide the conquest of thy sight mine eye my heart thy pictures sight would bar my heart mine eye the freedom of that right my heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie a closet never pierced with crystal eyes but the defendant doth that plea deny and says in him thy fair appearance lies to cide this title is impannelled a quest of thoughts all tenants to the heart and by their verdict is determined the clear eyes moiety and the dear hearts part as thus mine eyes due is thine outward part and my hearts right thine inward love of heart betwixt mine eye and heart a league is took and each doth good turns now unto the other when that mine eye is famishd for a look or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother with my loves picture then my eye doth feast and to the painted banquet bids my heart another time mine eye is my hearts guest and in his thoughts of love doth share a part so either by thy picture or my love thy self away art present still with me for thou not farther than my thoughts canst move and i am still with them and they with thee or if they sleep thy picture in my sight awakes my heart to hearts and eyes delight how careful was i when i took my way each trifle under truest bars to thrust that to my use it might unused stay from hands of falsehood in sure wards of trust but thou to whom my jewels trifles are most worthy comfort now my greatest grief thou best of dearest and mine only care art left the prey of every vulgar thief thee have i not locked up in any chest save where thou art not though i feel thou art within the gentle closure of my breast from whence at pleasure thou mayst come and part and even thence thou wilt be stoln i fear for truth proves thievish for a prize so dear against that time if ever that time come when i shall see thee frown on my defects when as thy love hath cast his utmost sum called to that audit by advisd respects against that time when thou shalt strangely pass and scarcely greet me with that sun thine eye when love converted from the thing it was shall reasons find of settled gravity against that time do i ensconce me here within the knowledge of mine own desert and this my hand against my self uprear to guard the lawful reasons on thy part to leave poor me thou hast the strength of laws since why to love i can allege no cause how heavy do i journey on the way when what i seek my weary travels end doth teach that ease and that repose to say thus far the miles are measured from thy friend the beast that bears me tired with my woe plods dully on to bear that weight in me as if by some instinct the wretch did know his rider lovd not speed being made from thee the bloody spur cannot provoke him on that sometimes anger thrusts into his hide which heavily he answers with a groan more sharp to me than spurring to his side for that same groan doth put this in my mind my grief lies onward and my joy behind thus can my love excuse the slow offence of my dull bearer when from thee i speed from where thou art why should i haste me thence till i return of posting is no need o what excuse will my poor beast then find when swift extremity can seem but slow then should i spur though mounted on the wind in winged speed no motion shall i know then can no horse with my desire keep pace therefore desire of perfectst love being made shall neigh no dull flesh in his fiery race but love for love thus shall excuse my jade since from thee going he went wilfulslow towards thee ill run and give him leave to go so am i as the rich whose blessed key can bring him to his sweet uplocked treasure the which he will not every hour survey for blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure therefore are feasts so solemn and so rare since seldom coming in the long year set like stones of worth they thinly placed are or captain jewels in the carcanet so is the time that keeps you as my chest or as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide to make some special instant specialblest by new unfolding his imprisoned pride blessed are you whose worthiness gives scope being had to triumph being lacked to hope what is your substance whereof are you made that millions of strange shadows on you tend since every one hath every one one shade and you but one can every shadow lend describe adonis and the counterfeit is poorly imitated after you on helens cheek all art of beauty set and you in grecian tires are painted new speak of the spring and foison of the year the one doth shadow of your beauty show the other as your bounty doth appear and you in every blessed shape we know in all external grace you have some part but you like none none you for constant heart o how much more doth beauty beauteous seem by that sweet ornament which truth doth give the rose looks fair but fairer we it deem for that sweet odour which doth in it live the canker blooms have full as deep a dye as the perfumed tincture of the roses hang on such thorns and play as wantonly when summers breath their masked buds discloses but for their virtue only is their show they live unwood and unrespected fade die to themselves sweet roses do not so of their sweet deaths are sweetest odours made and so of you beauteous and lovely youth when that shall vade my verse distills your truth not marble nor the gilded monuments of princes shall outlive this powerful rhyme but you shall shine more bright in these contents than unswept stone besmeard with sluttish time when wasteful war shall statues overturn and broils root out the work of masonry nor mars his sword nor wars quick fire shall burn the living record of your memory gainst death and all oblivious enmity shall you pace forth your praise shall still find room even in the eyes of all posterity that wear this world out to the ending doom so till the judgment that yourself arise you live in this and dwell in lovers eyes sweet love renew thy force be it not said thy edge should blunter be than appetite which but today by feeding is allayed tomorrow sharpened in his former might so love be thou although today thou fill thy hungry eyes even till they wink with fulness tomorrow see again and do not kill the spirit of love with a perpetual dulness let this sad interim like the ocean be which parts the shore where two contracted new come daily to the banks that when they see return of love more blest may be the view as call it winter which being full of care makes summers welcome thrice more wished more rare being your slave what should i do but tend upon the hours and times of your desire i have no precious time at all to spend nor services to do till you require nor dare i chide the world without end hour whilst i my sovereign watch the clock for you nor think the bitterness of absence sour when you have bid your servant once adieu nor dare i question with my jealous thought where you may be or your affairs suppose but like a sad slave stay and think of nought save where you are how happy you make those so true a fool is love that in your will though you do anything he thinks no ill that god forbid that made me first your slave i should in thought control your times of pleasure or at your hand the account of hours to crave being your vassal bound to stay your leisure o let me suffer being at your beck the imprisond absence of your liberty and patience tame to sufferance bide each check without accusing you of injury be where you list your charter is so strong that you yourself may privilege your time to what you will to you it doth belong yourself to pardon of selfdoing crime i am to wait though waiting so be hell not blame your pleasure be it ill or well if there be nothing new but that which is hath been before how are our brains beguild which labouring for invention bear amiss the second burthen of a former child oh that record could with a backward look even of five hundred courses of the sun show me your image in some antique book since mind at first in character was done that i might see what the old world could say to this composed wonder of your frame whether we are mended or where better they or whether revolution be the same oh sure i am the wits of former days to subjects worse have given admiring praise like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore so do our minutes hasten to their end each changing place with that which goes before in sequent toil all forwards do contend nativity once in the main of light crawls to maturity wherewith being crownd crooked eclipses gainst his glory fight and time that gave doth now his gift confound time doth transfix the flourish set on youth and delves the parallels in beautys brow feeds on the rarities of natures truth and nothing stands but for his scythe to mow and yet to times in hope my verse shall stand praising thy worth despite his cruel hand is it thy will thy image should keep open my heavy eyelids to the weary night dost thou desire my slumbers should be broken while shadows like to thee do mock my sight is it thy spirit that thou sendst from thee so far from home into my deeds to pry to find out shames and idle hours in me the scope and tenor of thy jealousy o no thy love though much is not so great it is my love that keeps mine eye awake mine own true love that doth my rest defeat to play the watchman ever for thy sake for thee watch i whilst thou dost wake elsewhere from me far off with others all too near sin of selflove possesseth all mine eye and all my soul and all my every part and for this sin there is no remedy it is so grounded inward in my heart methinks no face so gracious is as mine no shape so true no truth of such account and for myself mine own worth do define as i all other in all worths surmount but when my glass shows me myself indeed beated and choppd with tanned antiquity mine own selflove quite contrary i read self so selfloving were iniquity tis thee myself that for myself i praise painting my age with beauty of thy days against my love shall be as i am now with times injurious hand crushed and oerworn when hours have drained his blood and filled his brow with lines and wrinkles when his youthful morn hath travelled on to ages steepy night and all those beauties whereof now hes king are vanishing or vanished out of sight stealing away the treasure of his spring for such a time do i now fortify against confounding ages cruel knife that he shall never cut from memory my sweet loves beauty though my lovers life his beauty shall in these black lines be seen and they shall live and he in them still green when i have seen by times fell hand defaced the rich proud cost of outworn buried age when sometime lofty towers i see downrazed and brass eternal slave to mortal rage when i have seen the hungry ocean gain advantage on the kingdom of the shore and the firm soil win of the watery main increasing store with loss and loss with store when i have seen such interchange of state or state itself confounded to decay ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate that time will come and take my love away this thought is as a death which cannot choose but weep to have that which it fears to lose since brass nor stone nor earth nor boundless sea but sad mortality oersways their power how with this rage shall beauty hold a plea whose action is no stronger than a flower o how shall summers honey breath hold out against the wrackful siege of battering days when rocks impregnable are not so stout nor gates of steel so strong but time decays o fearful meditation where alack shall times best jewel from times chest lie hid or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back or who his spoil of beauty can forbid o none unless this miracle have might that in black ink my love may still shine bright tired with all these for restful death i cry as to behold desert a beggar born and needy nothing trimmd in jollity and purest faith unhappily forsworn and gilded honour shamefully misplaced and maiden virtue rudely strumpeted and right perfection wrongfully disgraced and strength by limping sway disabled and art made tonguetied by authority and folly doctorlike controlling skill and simple truth miscalled simplicity and captive good attending captain ill tired with all these from these would i be gone save that to die i leave my love alone ah wherefore with infection should he live and with his presence grace impiety that sin by him advantage should achieve and lace itself with his society why should false painting imitate his cheek and steal dead seeming of his living hue why should poor beauty indirectly seek roses of shadow since his rose is true why should he live now nature bankrupt is beggared of blood to blush through lively veins for she hath no exchequer now but his and proud of many lives upon his gains o him she stores to show what wealth she had in days long since before these last so bad thus is his cheek the map of days outworn when beauty lived and died as flowers do now before these bastard signs of fair were born or durst inhabit on a living brow before the golden tresses of the dead the right of sepulchres were shorn away to live a second life on second head ere beautys dead fleece made another gay in him those holy antique hours are seen without all ornament itself and true making no summer of anothers green robbing no old to dress his beauty new and him as for a map doth nature store to show false art what beauty was of yore those parts of thee that the worlds eye doth view want nothing that the thought of hearts can mend all tongues the voice of souls give thee that due uttering bare truth even so as foes commend thy outward thus with outward praise is crownd but those same tongues that give thee so thine own in other accents do this praise confound by seeing farther than the eye hath shown they look into the beauty of thy mind and that in guess they measure by thy deeds then churls their thoughts although their eyes were kind to thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds but why thy odour matcheth not thy show the soil is this that thou dost common grow that thou art blamed shall not be thy defect for slanders mark was ever yet the fair the ornament of beauty is suspect a crow that flies in heavens sweetest air so thou be good slander doth but approve thy worth the greater being wooed of time for canker vice the sweetest buds doth love and thou presentst a pure unstained prime thou hast passed by the ambush of young days either not assailed or victor being charged yet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise to tie up envy evermore enlarged if some suspect of ill masked not thy show then thou alone kingdoms of hearts shouldst owe no longer mourn for me when i am dead than you shall hear the surly sullen bell give warning to the world that i am fled from this vile world with vilest worms to dwell nay if you read this line remember not the hand that writ it for i love you so that i in your sweet thoughts would be forgot if thinking on me then should make you woe o if i say you look upon this verse when i perhaps compounded am with clay do not so much as my poor name rehearse but let your love even with my life decay lest the wise world should look into your moan and mock you with me after i am gone o lest the world should task you to recite what merit lived in me that you should love after my deathdear love forget me quite for you in me can nothing worthy prove unless you would devise some virtuous lie to do more for me than mine own desert and hang more praise upon deceased i than niggard truth would willingly impart o lest your true love may seem false in this that you for love speak well of me untrue my name be buried where my body is and live no more to shame nor me nor you for i am shamed by that which i bring forth and so should you to love things nothing worth that time of year thou mayst in me behold when yellow leaves or none or few do hang upon those boughs which shake against the cold bare ruined choirs where late the sweet birds sang in me thou seest the twilight of such day as after sunset fadeth in the west which by and by black night doth take away deaths second self that seals up all in rest in me thou seest the glowing of such fire that on the ashes of his youth doth lie as the deathbed whereon it must expire consumed with that which it was nourishd by this thou perceivst which makes thy love more strong to love that well which thou must leave ere long but be contented when that fell arrest without all bail shall carry me away my life hath in this line some interest which for memorial still with thee shall stay when thou reviewest this thou dost review the very part was consecrate to thee the earth can have but earth which is his due my spirit is thine the better part of me so then thou hast but lost the dregs of life the prey of worms my body being dead the coward conquest of a wretchs knife too base of thee to be remembered the worth of that is that which it contains and that is this and this with thee remains so are you to my thoughts as food to life or as sweetseasond showers are to the ground and for the peace of you i hold such strife as twixt a miser and his wealth is found now proud as an enjoyer and anon doubting the filching age will steal his treasure now counting best to be with you alone then betterd that the world may see my pleasure sometime all full with feasting on your sight and by and by clean starved for a look possessing or pursuing no delight save what is had or must from you be took thus do i pine and surfeit day by day or gluttoning on all or all away why is my verse so barren of new pride so far from variation or quick change why with the time do i not glance aside to newfound methods and to compounds strange why write i still all one ever the same and keep invention in a noted weed that every word doth almost tell my name showing their birth and where they did proceed o know sweet love i always write of you and you and love are still my argument so all my best is dressing old words new spending again what is already spent for as the sun is daily new and old so is my love still telling what is told thy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear thy dial how thy precious minutes waste the vacant leaves thy minds imprint will bear and of this book this learning mayst thou taste the wrinkles which thy glass will truly show of mouthed graves will give thee memory thou by thy dials shady stealth mayst know times thievish progress to eternity look what thy memory cannot contain commit to these waste blanks and thou shalt find those children nursed delivered from thy brain to take a new acquaintance of thy mind these offices so oft as thou wilt look shall profit thee and much enrich thy book so oft have i invoked thee for my muse and found such fair assistance in my verse as every alien pen hath got my use and under thee their poesy disperse thine eyes that taught the dumb on high to sing and heavy ignorance aloft to fly have added feathers to the learneds wing and given grace a double majesty yet be most proud of that which i compile whose influence is thine and born of thee in others works thou dost but mend the style and arts with thy sweet graces graced be but thou art all my art and dost advance as high as learning my rude ignorance whilst i alone did call upon thy aid my verse alone had all thy gentle grace but now my gracious numbers are decayed and my sick muse doth give an other place i grant sweet love thy lovely argument deserves the travail of a worthier pen yet what of thee thy poet doth invent he robs thee of and pays it thee again he lends thee virtue and he stole that word from thy behaviour beauty doth he give and found it in thy cheek he can afford no praise to thee but what in thee doth live then thank him not for that which he doth say since what he owes thee thou thyself dost pay o how i faint when i of you do write knowing a better spirit doth use your name and in the praise thereof spends all his might to make me tonguetied speaking of your fame but since your worth wide as the ocean is the humble as the proudest sail doth bear my saucy bark inferior far to his on your broad main doth wilfully appear your shallowest help will hold me up afloat whilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride or being wracked i am a worthless boat he of tall building and of goodly pride then if he thrive and i be cast away the worst was this my love was my decay or i shall live your epitaph to make or you survive when i in earth am rotten from hence your memory death cannot take although in me each part will be forgotten your name from hence immortal life shall have though i once gone to all the world must die the earth can yield me but a common grave when you entombed in mens eyes shall lie your monument shall be my gentle verse which eyes not yet created shall oerread and tongues to be your being shall rehearse when all the breathers of this world are dead you still shall live such virtue hath my pen where breath most breathes even in the mouths of men i grant thou wert not married to my muse and therefore mayst without attaint oerlook the dedicated words which writers use of their fair subject blessing every book thou art as fair in knowledge as in hue finding thy worth a limit past my praise and therefore art enforced to seek anew some fresher stamp of the timebettering days and do so love yet when they have devised what strained touches rhetoric can lend thou truly fair wert truly sympathized in true plain words by thy truetelling friend and their gross painting might be better used where cheeks need blood in thee it is abused i never saw that you did painting need and therefore to your fair no painting set i found or thought i found you did exceed the barren tender of a poets debt and therefore have i slept in your report that you yourself being extant well might show how far a modern quill doth come too short speaking of worth what worth in you doth grow this silence for my sin you did impute which shall be most my glory being dumb for i impair not beauty being mute when others would give life and bring a tomb there lives more life in one of your fair eyes than both your poets can in praise devise who is it that says most which can say more than this rich praise that you alone are you in whose confine immured is the store which should example where your equal grew lean penury within that pen doth dwell that to his subject lends not some small glory but he that writes of you if he can tell that you are you so dignifies his story let him but copy what in you is writ not making worse what nature made so clear and such a counterpart shall fame his wit making his style admired every where you to your beauteous blessings add a curse being fond on praise which makes your praises worse my tonguetied muse in manners holds her still while comments of your praise richly compiled reserve thy character with golden quill and precious phrase by all the muses filed i think good thoughts whilst others write good words and like unlettered clerk still cry amen to every hymn that able spirit affords in polished form of wellrefined pen hearing you praised i say tis so tis true and to the most of praise add something more but that is in my thought whose love to you though words come hindmost holds his rank before then others for the breath of words respect me for my dumb thoughts speaking in effect was it the proud full sail of his great verse bound for the prize of all too precious you that did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse making their tomb the womb wherein they grew was it his spirit by spirits taught to write above a mortal pitch that struck me dead no neither he nor his compeers by night giving him aid my verse astonished he nor that affable familiar ghost which nightly gulls him with intelligence as victors of my silence cannot boast i was not sick of any fear from thence but when your countenance filled up his line then lacked i matter that enfeebled mine farewell thou art too dear for my possessing and like enough thou knowst thy estimate the charter of thy worth gives thee releasing my bonds in thee are all determinate for how do i hold thee but by thy granting and for that riches where is my deserving the cause of this fair gift in me is wanting and so my patent back again is swerving thy self thou gavest thy own worth then not knowing or me to whom thou gavst it else mistaking so thy great gift upon misprision growing comes home again on better judgement making thus have i had thee as a dream doth flatter in sleep a king but waking no such matter when thou shalt be disposed to set me light and place my merit in the eye of scorn upon thy side against myself ill fight and prove thee virtuous though thou art forsworn with mine own weakness being best acquainted upon thy part i can set down a story of faults concealed wherein i am attainted that thou in losing me shalt win much glory and i by this will be a gainer too for bending all my loving thoughts on thee the injuries that to myself i do doing thee vantage doublevantage me such is my love to thee i so belong that for thy right myself will bear all wrong say that thou didst forsake me for some fault and i will comment upon that offence speak of my lameness and i straight will halt against thy reasons making no defence thou canst not love disgrace me half so ill to set a form upon desired change as ill myself disgrace knowing thy will i will acquaintance strangle and look strange be absent from thy walks and in my tongue thy sweet beloved name no more shall dwell lest i too much profane should do it wrong and haply of our old acquaintance tell for thee against my self ill vow debate for i must neer love him whom thou dost hate then hate me when thou wilt if ever now now while the world is bent my deeds to cross join with the spite of fortune make me bow and do not drop in for an afterloss ah do not when my heart hath scaped this sorrow come in the rearward of a conquered woe give not a windy night a rainy morrow to linger out a purposed overthrow if thou wilt leave me do not leave me last when other petty griefs have done their spite but in the onset come so shall i taste at first the very worst of fortunes might and other strains of woe which now seem woe compared with loss of thee will not seem so some glory in their birth some in their skill some in their wealth some in their bodys force some in their garments though newfangled ill some in their hawks and hounds some in their horse and every humour hath his adjunct pleasure wherein it finds a joy above the rest but these particulars are not my measure all these i better in one general best thy love is better than high birth to me richer than wealth prouder than garments cost of more delight than hawks and horses be and having thee of all mens pride i boast wretched in this alone that thou mayst take all this away and me most wretched make but do thy worst to steal thyself away for term of life thou art assured mine and life no longer than thy love will stay for it depends upon that love of thine then need i not to fear the worst of wrongs when in the least of them my life hath end i see a better state to me belongs than that which on thy humour doth depend thou canst not vex me with inconstant mind since that my life on thy revolt doth lie o what a happy title do i find happy to have thy love happy to die but whats so blessedfair that fears no blot thou mayst be false and yet i know it not so shall i live supposing thou art true like a deceived husband so loves face may still seem love to me though altered new thy looks with me thy heart in other place for there can live no hatred in thine eye therefore in that i cannot know thy change in manys looks the false hearts history is writ in moods and frowns and wrinkles strange but heaven in thy creation did decree that in thy face sweet love should ever dwell whateer thy thoughts or thy hearts workings be thy looks should nothing thence but sweetness tell how like eves apple doth thy beauty grow if thy sweet virtue answer not thy show they that have power to hurt and will do none that do not do the thing they most do show who moving others are themselves as stone unmoved cold and to temptation slow they rightly do inherit heavens graces and husband natures riches from expense they are the lords and owners of their faces others but stewards of their excellence the summers flower is to the summer sweet though to itself it only live and die but if that flower with base infection meet the basest weed outbraves his dignity for sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds how sweet and lovely dost thou make the shame which like a canker in the fragrant rose doth spot the beauty of thy budding name o in what sweets dost thou thy sins enclose that tongue that tells the story of thy days making lascivious comments on thy sport cannot dispraise but in a kind of praise naming thy name blesses an ill report o what a mansion have those vices got which for their habitation chose out thee where beautys veil doth cover every blot and all things turns to fair that eyes can see take heed dear heart of this large privilege the hardest knife illused doth lose his edge some say thy fault is youth some wantonness some say thy grace is youth and gentle sport both grace and faults are lovd of more and less thou makst faults graces that to thee resort as on the finger of a throned queen the basest jewel will be well esteemd so are those errors that in thee are seen to truths translated and for true things deemd how many lambs might the stern wolf betray if like a lamb he could his looks translate how many gazers mightst thou lead away if thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state but do not so i love thee in such sort as thou being mine mine is thy good report how like a winter hath my absence been from thee the pleasure of the fleeting year what freezings have i felt what dark days seen what old decembers bareness everywhere and yet this time removed was summers time the teeming autumn big with rich increase bearing the wanton burden of the prime like widowd wombs after their lords decease yet this abundant issue seemed to me but hope of orphans and unfathered fruit for summer and his pleasures wait on thee and thou away the very birds are mute or if they sing tis with so dull a cheer that leaves look pale dreading the winters near from you have i been absent in the spring when proud pied april dressed in all his trim hath put a spirit of youth in every thing that heavy saturn laughed and leapt with him yet nor the lays of birds nor the sweet smell of different flowers in odour and in hue could make me any summers story tell or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew nor did i wonder at the lilys white nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose they were but sweet but figures of delight drawn after you you pattern of all those yet seemed it winter still and you away as with your shadow i with these did play the forward violet thus did i chide sweet thief whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells if not from my loves breath the purple pride which on thy soft cheek for complexion dwells in my loves veins thou hast too grossly dyd the lily i condemned for thy hand and buds of marjoram had stoln thy hair the roses fearfully on thorns did stand one blushing shame another white despair a third nor red nor white had stoln of both and to his robbery had annexed thy breath but for his theft in pride of all his growth a vengeful canker eat him up to death more flowers i noted yet i none could see but sweet or colour it had stoln from thee where art thou muse that thou forgetst so long to speak of that which gives thee all thy might spendst thou thy fury on some worthless song darkening thy power to lend base subjects light return forgetful muse and straight redeem in gentle numbers time so idly spent sing to the ear that doth thy lays esteem and gives thy pen both skill and argument rise resty muse my loves sweet face survey if time have any wrinkle graven there if any be a satire to decay and make times spoils despised every where give my love fame faster than time wastes life so thou preventst his scythe and crooked knife o truant muse what shall be thy amends for thy neglect of truth in beauty dyed both truth and beauty on my love depends so dost thou too and therein dignified make answer muse wilt thou not haply say truth needs no colour with his colour fixed beauty no pencil beautys truth to lay but best is best if never intermixed because he needs no praise wilt thou be dumb excuse not silence so fort lies in thee to make him much outlive a gilded tomb and to be praised of ages yet to be then do thy office muse i teach thee how to make him seem long hence as he shows now my love is strengthened though more weak in seeming i love not less though less the show appear that love is merchandized whose rich esteeming the owners tongue doth publish every where our love was new and then but in the spring when i was wont to greet it with my lays as philomel in summers front doth sing and stops his pipe in growth of riper days not that the summer is less pleasant now than when her mournful hymns did hush the night but that wild music burthens every bough and sweets grown common lose their dear delight therefore like her i sometime hold my tongue because i would not dull you with my song
