    "## Problem Description\n",
    "In the competitive rubber chicken retail market, the success of a company is built on satisfying the exacting standards of a consumer base with refined and discriminating taste. In particular, customer product reviews are all important. But how should we judge the quality of a product based on customer reviews?\n",
    "\n",
    "On Amazon, the first customer review statistic displayed for a product is the ***average rating***. The following are the main product pages for two competing rubber chicken products, manufactured by Lotus World and Toysmith respectively:\n",

    "Clicking on the 'customer review' link on the product pages takes us to a detailed break-down of the reviews. In particular, we can now see the number of times a product is rated a given rating (between 1 and 5 stars).\n",

    "$$\n",
    "  where $\\theta_i$ is the probability that a given customer will give the product $i$ number of stars. That is, each new rating (a value between 1 and 5) has a categorical distribution $Cat(\\theta)$. Represent the observed ratings of an Amazon product as a vector $R = [r_1, r_2, r_3, r_4, r_5]$ where, for example, $r_4$ is the number of $4$-star reviews out of a total of $N$ ratings. Write down the likelihood of $R$. That is, what is $p(R| \\theta)$?\n",

    "\n",
    "Starting in 2020, major machine learning conferences are beginning to ask authors as well as reviewers to explicitly consider the broader impact of new machine learning methods. To properly evaluate the potential good or harm that a piece of technology (AI or not) can do to the general public, we need to be aware that no technology is deployed in ideal conditions or in perfectly neutral contexts. In order to assess the potential broader impact of technology, we need to analyze the social systems/institutions of which these technologies will become a part.\n",

    "I. Identify the relevant socio-technical systems\n",
    "  - In what social, political, economic system could the tech be deployed?\n",
    "  - How would the tech be used in these systems (what role will it take in the decision making processes)?<br><br>\n",
    "  \n",
    "II. Identify the stakeholders\n",
    "  - Who are the users?\n",
    "  - Who are the affected communities (are these the users)?\n",
    "  \n",
    "    ***Hint:*** users are typically decision makers who will use the technology as decision aids (e.g. doctors), whereas affected communities may be folks who are impacted by these decisions but who are not represented in the decision making process (e.g. patients).<br><br>\n",
    "    \n",
    "III. What types of harm can this tech do?\n",
    "  - What kinds of failures can this tech have?\n",
    "  - What kinds of direct harm can these failures cause?\n",
    "  - What kinds of harm can the socio-technical system cause?\n",
    "  \n",
    "    ***Hint:*** many technical innovations have niche applications, they may sit in a long chain of decision making in a complex system. As such, it may seem, at first glance, that these technologies have no immediate real-life impact. In these cases, it’s helpful to think about the impact of the entire system and then think about how the proposed innovations aid, hamper or change the goals or outcomes of this system.<br><br>\n",
    "    \n",
    "IV. What types of good can this tech do?\n",
    "  - What kinds of needs do these users/communities have?\n",
    "  - What kinds of constraints do these users/communities have?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **(Impact)** Analyze the broader impact of models of product popularity/quality when used for ranking. Specifically, focus on anticipating ways these models can interact with other components of the decision systems in which they will be deployed, identifying end-users, affected communities as well as anticipating the effects (positive and negative) on affected communities (in particular, does the model have the same effect on all subpopulations in the affected communities?)."
