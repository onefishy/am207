    "Suppose you are building a pricing model for laying down new fibre optics high-speed internet cables under region in the Boston area. Your model takes as input a pair of  coordinates, $(x, y)$, and contains two parameters, $\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2$. Given a coordinate, $(x, y)$, and model parameters, the loss in revenue corresponding to the price model at location $(x, y)$ is described by\n",

Which method converges to the optimal point in fewer iterations? Briefly explain why this result should be expected.<br><br>\n",

    "### Part II: Broader Impact Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting in 2020, major machine learning conferences are beginning to ask authors as well as reviewers to explicitly consider the broader impact of new machine learning methods. To properly evaluate the potential good or harm that a piece of technology (AI or not) can do to the general public, we need to be aware that no technology is deployed in ideal conditions or in perfectly neutral contexts. In order to assess the potential broader impact of technology, we need to analyze the social systems/institutions of which these technologies will become a part.\n",
    "\n",
    "To help you analyze the broader impact of your technology, begin by considering the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "I. Identify the relevant socio-technical systems\n",
    "  - In what social, political, economic system could the tech be deployed?\n",
    "  - How would the tech be used in these systems (what role will it take in the decision making processes)?<br><br>\n",
    "  \n",
    "II. Identify the stakeholders\n",
    "  - Who are the users?\n",
    "  - Who are the affected communities (are these the users)?\n",
    "  \n",
    "    ***Hint:*** users are typically decision makers who will use the technology as decision aids (e.g. doctors), whereas affected communities may be folks who are impacted by these decisions but who are not represented in the decision making process (e.g. patients).<br><br>\n",
    "    \n",
    "III. What types of harm can this tech do?\n",
    "  - What kinds of failures can this tech have?\n",
    "  - What kinds of direct harm can these failures cause?\n",
    "  - What kinds of harm can the socio-technical system cause?\n",
    "  \n",
    "    ***Hint:*** many technical innovations have niche applications, they may sit in a long chain of decision making in a complex system. As such, it may seem, at first glance, that these technologies have no immediate real-life impact. In these cases, it’s helpful to think about the impact of the entire system and then think about how the proposed innovations aid, hamper or change the goals or outcomes of this system.<br><br>\n",
    "    \n",
    "IV. What types of good can this tech do?\n",
    "  - What kinds of needs do these users/communities have?\n",
    "  - What kinds of constraints do these users/communities have?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **(Impact)** Analyze the broader impact of this pricing model. Focus on anticipating ways these models can interact with other components of the decision systems in which they will be deployed, identifying end-users, affected communities as well as anticipating the effects (positive and negative) on affected communities (in particular, does the model have the same effect on all subpopulations in the affected communities?). \n",
    "\n",
    "  ***Hint:*** the objective function we are minimizing here is the construction cost, who benifits from minimizing the this objective function, whose utility function might be in tension with this objective function?\n",
    "  \n",
    "  How do the quirks and artifacts of the optimization algorithm impact the end-user (i.e. how is your end-user affected by the optimization procedure and the hyperparameters you choose)? How do your design choices in optimization impact the affected community?"
