# Course Syllabus

### What is this Course?
The aim of this course is to help students develops skills for computational research with focus on stochastic approaches, emphasizing implementation and examples. Stochastic methods make it feasible to tackle very diverse problems when the solution space is too large to explore systematically, or when microscopic rules are known, but not the macroscopic behavior of a complex system. Methods are illustrated with examples from a wide variety of fields, like demography, health-care, and finance. We tackle Bayesian methods of data analysis as well as various stochastic optimization methods. Topics include stochastic optimization (stochastic gradient descent and simulated annealing), Bayesian models and approximate inference methods (Markov chain Monte Carlo and variational inference).

### Learning Outcomes

After successful completion of this course, you will be able to:
1. Build basic Bayesian and non-Bayesian statistical models for continuous, ordinal, categorical and sequential data
2. Learn point estimates of model parameters using stochastic optimization methods
3. Perform inference on models using sampling methods as well as variational inference approaches
4. Evaluate the effectiveness of your inference methods
5. Evaluate the usefulness/appropriateness of your models
6. Implement inference methods from scratch in `python`
7. Build statistical models and perform inference using python libraries

### General Information:
This course follows a flipped classroom structure. The lectures are pre-recorded and made available at the beginning of each week. Students are expected to watch the relevant lecture videos and study the lecture materials before the class meeting. 

Each class meeting will consists of 1) a discussion portion where students discuss the materials that they had studied, and 2) a practical exercise portion where students work in small teams on a coding or qualitative analysis exercise applying the concepts from lecture/readings to a small example. Students are expected to actively participate in both the class discussion as well as the practical exercise. You will not be able to complete the exercise if you do not study the lecture videos and materials before class!

The pre-recorded lectures will be broken into segments, after each segment there will be a short concept quiz based on the lecture material. 

The in-class practical exercises will be collected at the end of each class and graded for effort. 

There will be 10 weekly individual assignments and a team project. All assignments (including the project) will emphasize both the mastery of theoretical concepts as well as python implementation. There will be a Canvas website for this course, assignments, lecture notes and all course related information/announcements will be posted online. Regular class attendance and participation is essential for this course and is expected of all students.

### Course Schedule:

### Course Materials:
You recommended to get the textbook *Bayesian Data Analysis* by Andrew Gelman, John Carlin, Hal Stern, David Dunson, Aki Vehtari, and Donald Rubin (3rd Edition). We will be using this text as a reference for statistical modeling but the course will not follow the content or structure of the text faithfully! In addition to readings from the text book, relevant reference papers will be recommended for topics.
To complete the assignments, you must either install (on your own machine) `Jupyter` `Notebook` with `python` 3.7 or familiarize yourself with [Google Colab] (https://colab.research.google.com/).

### Grading:

- Concept Quizzes: 5% 
- Homework #0-9: 60% 
- In-class Exercises: 5% 
- Project: 30%

You may drop your lowest homework grade.

### Homework:
Homework will be assigned weekly. You are welcome to seek help on the individ- ual homework assignments from other students, your TFs and your instructor. While collaboration is encouraged, copy is strictly forbidden. Submissions that are highly similar will be flagged and all such submission may be returned without a grade.
**Late submission policy:** Each student is allowed 3 late days over the semester to be applied to any one or two homework. Outside of these allotted late days, late homework will not be accepted.
Homework, like all assignments in this class, will be graded for correctness as well as clarity of exposition and presentation (a “right” answer by itself without an explanation or is presented with a difficult to follow format will receive no credit).

### Project:
During the semester, you will work on a project reading, understanding and implementing a model or inference method from an staff approved research paper. The deliverable is a `Jupyter` `notebook` tutorial containing a summary of the main ideas of the paper (with concrete pedagogical examples) and code implementing the main methods of the paper. You must work in a team of size 2 to 4 people.

### Expectations and Policies:
**Respect for Diversity:** It is the mission of the teaching staff that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well served by this course, that students’ learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength and benefit. We aim to create a learning environment that is inclusive and respectful of diversity: gender, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, and culture. Your suggestions for how to better our classroom community are always encouraged and appreciated.As a large part of this course requires students to work in groups, in alignment with our teaching mission, we ask that students explicitly reflect on and implement practices for building teams that are diverse along many axes. Students who enroll in AM207 traditionally come from a wide range of technical, cultural and other demographic backgrounds, we hope that each student group can benefit from these diverse perspectives and experiences. The teaching staff is happy to help you brainstorm how to create an inclusive and productive working culture for your team.

**Academic Integrity:** Discussion and the exchange of ideas are essential to doing academic work. For assignments in this course, you are encouraged to consult with your classmates as you work on problem sets. However, after discussions with peers (or course instructional staff such as tutors, TF/TAs, course assistants), make sure that you can work through the problem yourself and ensure that any answers you submit for evaluation are the result of your own efforts. In addition, you must cite any books, articles, websites, lectures, etc that have helped you with your work using appropriate citation practices. Similarly, you must list the names of students with whom you have collaborated on problem sets.

### Help for the Course:
There will be weekly instructor office hours for the course. Please feel free to take full advantage of my office hours. If you wish to meet with me outside of office hours please contact me via email or speak to me in person. 

In addition to instructor office hours, there will be at least one TF office hour each day, Sunday through Thursday.

Please do not email non-logistical questions (e.g. questions about concepts covered in lecture or assignments) directly to the teaching staff. Due to the volume of emails we receive daily, the teaching staff will not answer questions related to course materials through personal emails. 

There will be a course Piazza, where students are encouraged to discuss their questions and ideas about the course material. Discussions will be moderated by the teaching staff, but the staff is not in charge of answering Piazza questions! To get your questions answered by the teaching staff you must attend office hours or make a separate appointment.
