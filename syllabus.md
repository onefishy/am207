# Course Syllabus

### What is this Course?
The aim of this course is to help students develops skills for computational research with focus on stochastic approaches, emphasizing implementation and examples. Stochastic methods make it feasible to tackle very diverse problems when the solution space is too large to explore systematically, or when micr scopic rules are known, but not the macroscopic behavior of a complex system. Methods are illustrated with examples from a wide variety of fields, like biology, finance, and physics. We tackle Bayesian methods of data analysis as well as various stochastic optimization methods. Topics include stochastic optimization such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and simulated annealing, Bayesian data analysis, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), and variational analysis.

### Learning Outcomes

After successful completion of this course, you will be able to:
1. Build basic Bayesian and non-Bayesian statistical models for continuous, ordinal, categorical and sequential data
2. Learn point estimates of model parameters using stochastic optimization methods
3. Perform inference on models using sampling methods as well as variational inference approaches
4. Evaluate the effectiveness of your inference methods
5. Evaluate the usefulness/appropriateness of your models
6. Implement inference methods from scratch in `python`
7. Build statistical models and perform inference using python libraries

### General Information:
There will be 10 weekly individual assignments and a team project. All assignments (including the project) will emphasize both the mastery of theoretical concepts as well as `python` implementation. There will be a Canvas website for this course, assignments, lecture notes and all course related information/announcements will be posted online. Regular class attendance and participation is essential for this course and is expected of all students.

### Course Materials:
You recommended to get the textbook *Bayesian Data Analysis* by Andrew Gelman, John Carlin, Hal Stern, David Dunson, Aki Vehtari, and Donald Rubin (3rd Edition). We will be using this text as a reference for statistical modeling but the course will not follow the content or structure of the text faithfully! In addition to readings from the text book, relevant reference papers will be recommended for topics.
To complete the assignments, you must either install (on your own machine) `Jupyter` `Notebook` with `python` 3.7 or familiarize yourself with [Google Colab] (https://colab.research.google.com/).

### Grading:

- *Homework #0-9:* 10 each
- *Project:* 30 each

You may drop your lowest homework grade.

### Homework:
Homework will be assigned weekly. You are welcome to seek help on the individ- ual homework assignments from other students, your TFs and your instructor. While collaboration is encouraged, copy is strictly forbidden. Submissions that are highly similar will be flagged and all such submission may be returned without a grade.
**Late submission policy:** Each student is allowed 2 late days over the semester to be applied to any one or two homework. Outside of these allotted late days, late homework will not be accepted.
Homework, like all assignments in this class, will be graded for correctness as well as clarity of exposition and presentation (a “right” answer by itself without an explanation or is presented with a difficult to follow format will receive no credit).

### Project:
During the semester, you will work on a project reading, understanding and implementing a model or inference method from an staff approved research paper. The deliverable is a `Jupyter` `notebook` tutorial containing a summary of the main ideas of the paper (with concrete pedagogical examples) and code implementing the main methods of the paper. You must work in a team of size 2 to 4 people.

### Expectations and Policies:
**Attendance:** You are strongly encouraged to attend the lectures as well as the labs. Attendance will be taken at every class, although it is not graded. Students who do not regularly attend lectures may be given lower priority during Q&A in office hours.

### Help for the Course:
There are two instructor office hours for the course. On Tuesdays, the office hour is unstructured (reserved for Q&A). On Fridays, the office hour is structured
like a lab where we all study concrete examples of concepts introduced during lecture.
Please feel free to take full advantage of my office hours. If you wish to meet with me outside of office hours please contact me via email or speak to me in person.

In addition to instructor office hours, there will be one TF office hour each day, Monday through Friday.

There will be a course Piazza, where students are encouraged to discuss their questions and ideas about the course material. Discussions will be moderated by the teaching staff, but ***the staff is not in charge of answering Piazza questions***! To get your questions answered by the teaching staff you must attend office hours or make a separate appointment.
