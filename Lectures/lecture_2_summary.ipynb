    "1. **(Fitting Probabilistic Models)** Given a probabilistic model with parameters $\\theta$, i.e. a model that explicitly accounts for the noise in the data. We learn $\\theta$ that maximizes the likelihood of the observed data.\n",
    "  - **Sanity Check:** What is the noise model for the binomial model of coin tosses?<br><br>\n",
    "  \n",
    "2. **(Maximizing the Likelihood)** Maximizing the likelihood over $\\theta$ is an *optimization problem*. In an optimization problem, we by convention turn every maximization problem (e.g. maximize $g(\\theta)$) into a minimization problem (e.g. minimize $-g(\\theta)$) and then:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - if there are no constraints, we identify the stationary points of the objective function and verify that the objective function is convex. In this case, the stationary points are local min, and every local min is a global min.<br><br>\n",
    "  - if there are constraints, we identify the stationary points of the Lagrangian and verify that the objective function is convex and the equality constraints are affine. In this case, every stationary point is a global min.<br><br>\n",
    "  \n",
    "3. **(Why MLE)** Why should we learn $\\theta$ to maximize the likelihood? What is the philosophical basis for performing MLE?<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **(What Are Desirable Properties of Estimators)** If we have a method to produce an estimate $\\widehat{\\theta}$ of the true model parameters $\\theta$, what properties would we want from our estimate?\n",
    "\n",
    "  - ***(Consistency)*** What is consistency and why do we, as practitioners, care?\n",

    "5. **(Why Not MLE)** Which properties does MLE have? And which ones does it lack? What does this mean for practiioners using MLE - what do we need to watch out for?<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **(Uncertainty)** We said that maximize the likelihood gives us one \"best\" estimate of the model parameters. But how can we get uncertainty on our estimates (e.g. what is bootstrapping)?"
