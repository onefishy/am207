    "  - With regression it's easy, you plug $x_n$ into $f_{\\theta_\\text{MLE}}(x)$ and then compare the prediction $\\widehat{y}_n$ with $y$. But what if we don't have any inputs, $x_n$, what if we just have $y_n$? In this case we would not be able to predict a $\\widehat{y}_n$ for a specific $y_n$.<br><br>\n",
