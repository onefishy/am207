    "## FAQs About HMC\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Question:** HMC seems complicated, do I really need to use it?<br>\n",
    "  **Answer:** Yes. For complex models of interest (non-conjugate, hierarchical, latent variable) HMC is the least complicated sampler you can use to perform reliable inference.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Question:** Ok, but can I treat the theory as a black-box, i.e. can I just press some `model.sample()` button?<br>\n",
    "  **Answer:** No. HMC (like all samplers) must be tuned. That is, for many models and datasets, `model.sample()` will not have good performance. You need the theory to tell you which design choices need to be adjusted and in what way.<br><br>\n",
    "  \n",
    "3. **Question:** But I don't need to implement it since `pymc3` has already done so, right?<br>\n",
    "  **Answer:** You need to implement HMC. Because `pymc3` is not going to scale well for Bayesian inference for models with neural network likelihoods and large datasets. <br><br>\n",
    "  \n",
    "4. **Question:** We worked so hard to derive HMC, so it's state-of-the-art and can be applied to any Bayesian model for any dataset right?<br>\n",
    "  **Answer:** No. HMC may still be inefficient for complex posteriors and improving HMC is an active area of research (see this weeks readings). Futhermore, HMC **does not scale well to large datasets**."
