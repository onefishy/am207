    "  - Which counties are affected by a poor choice of prior?\n",

    "  - If you're just an engineer in a long ML pipeline in an industry setting, how much should you care about broader impact? Don't company have a legal and ethics department that handles all that?\n",
    "  - If you're just a in-house attorney or social scientist at a tech company, what properties of MLE, Bayesian, Empirical Bayes and Hierarchical Bayes models should you know?"
